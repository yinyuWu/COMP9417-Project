# COMP9417-Project
UNSW COMP9417 project: Topic2.2 Nearest Neighbour(kNN).

0. KNN is an abstract parent class of both KNN classification and KNN numerict prediction. labelEncoder.py is our own class to convert categorical labels into integers.

1. Classification: KNN_Class.py contains both naive KNN algorithm, weighted KNN algorithm for classification and leave-one-out cross validation of KNN classifiers.

2. Numeric Prediction: KNN_Numeric.py contains both naive KNN algorithm and weighted KNN algorithm for numeric prediction and leave-one-out cross validation.

3. Target functions and generated data: Target.py contains target functions and functions related to generated data.

4. summary, notebook jupyter notebooks and KNNwithNumpy folder contains all experiments we introduce in our report.

5. BallTree.py is a data structure of ball tree which is used to find k nearest neighbours in KNN classification.

6. scaler.py is our own MinMaxScaler
